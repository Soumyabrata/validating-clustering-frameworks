## Scripts

+ `read_data.py`: reads the raw data to generate (timestamp and electricity consumption data for each household in a NumPy array) - specific to the datatset used - should be replaced for another dataset
+ `main.py`: main program to perform the experiments
+ `utils/`: Contains utility functions that are used in the main program

# Note:
The dataset used in this project can not be disclosed due to external reasons. However, one may feel to use/modify the code as per their requirement.
